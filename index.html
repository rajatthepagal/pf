									<h3>FENU</h3>
									<p class="description">

									<div class="cover"></div>
									<h3>Submit without backend</h3>
									<p class="description">
										This one is special why? Because i took all of the submit by using scripts that are hosted over Google Docs spreadsheet. The spreadsheet scripts act as the backend for this form. Quite nifty i think. Got the idea from a npm post. Had to deal with AJAX here first time.

									<h3>MEGRID-a-CSS-Responsive-Framework</h3>
									<p class="description">
										I am not a BIG FAN of bootstrap. Ok i love its functionality and i understand its purpose of giving quick results when prototyping. But i have seen my friends and fellow learners to use it everytime whenever they want grids. Its like getting a hammer for killing a fly. So i though why not write my own Framework for this purpose. So i present MEGRID. As straight as the documentation says it gives you a grid and a slide menu bar in mobile view. Its is fully cutomizable since CSS specificity is to its minimum in the source code. And ya also this portfolio is build using it.

The Student can then log in his/her account to check for the test and appear in them. They get immediate report and teacher gets an immediate report of prformance.
